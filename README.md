This process is SLA SEV-A created above. I just created random tickets. (Illustration: computer and Network issue and Customers reporting that they cannot gain access to the registratio portal). Attending to tickets, I set priority to high, SLA plan to SEV-A, transfer from support dept to maintenance/ system administrator for quick solution because of the ticket's priority is high. Afetr I submitted a note that the engineering support agent is working on the recovery the online banking back network to normal, then I closed the tickets. </p>
